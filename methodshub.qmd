## Description

<!-- - Provide a brief and clear description of the method, its purpose, and what it aims to achieve. Add a link to a related paper from social science domain and show how your method can be applied to solve that research question.   -->

The package offers data structures and methods to work with web tracking data. The functions cover data preprocessing steps, enriching web tracking data with external information and methods for the analysis of digital behavior as used in several academic papers (e.g., Clemm von Hohenberg et al., 2023 [<doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/M3U9P>](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/M3U9P); Stier et al., 2022 [<doi:10.1017/S0003055421001222>](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421001222)).

## Keywords

<!-- EDITME -->

* Digital Behavioral Data 
* Webtracking
* Data Preprocessing

## Science Usecase(s)

Web tracking data provides a powerful tool for social science research, enabling the analysis of human behavior and interaction patterns in digital environments. By capturing detailed user activity, such as page visits, clickstreams, and time spent on various platforms, researchers can uncover insights into online decision-making, information diffusion, and social influence. This data can also be used to study phenomena like polarization or the impact of targeted advertising on public opinion. 

## Repository structure

This repository follows [the standard structure of an R package](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-exts.html#Package-structure).

## Environment Setup

With R installed:

```r
install.packages("webtrackR")
```

<!-- ## Hardware Requirements (Optional) -->
<!-- - The hardware requirements may be needed in specific cases when a method is known to require more memory/compute power.  -->
<!-- - The method need to be executed on a specific architecture (GPUs, Hadoop cluster etc.) -->


## Input Data 

<!-- - The input data has to be a Digital Behavioral Data (DBD) Dataset -->
<!-- - You can provide link to a public DBD dataset. GESIS DBD datasets (https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/digital-behavioral-data) -->

<!-- This is an example -->

`webtrackR` accepts accepts raw webtracking data as provided by GESIS.

## Sample Input and Output Data

The package includes a sample dataset of raw webtracking data. 

## How to Use

<!-- - Providing HowTos on the method for different types of usages -->
<!-- - Describe how the method should be used, including installation, configuration, and any specific instructions for users. -->
